Tweets Sample Test
The Test.py contains the scripts that calculates the profantity of each tweets stored within the dataset and places it in an array named profanity index.
The profanity words used are ("***","shit") and are not present is most tweets hence will give a low profanity value.
I have focused more on the logic and how to approach the problem.
